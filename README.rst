CppAnalyze
================

CppAnalyze is a `Clang`_-based C++ project to analyze C++ code.


The goal of this project is to provide a tool to analyze the code of a c++ project,
so as to:

 * rename members, functions, ... according to some project conventions
 * detect bad constructs not wanted in the project and emit a warning/error
 * correct the simplest ones


.. note::
   Currently CppAnalyze is hardly more than a Clang plugin example, and
   still in the state of a prototype.


Build
=====

You need a recent version of LLVM and Clang (the best is to get the svn
version, see the Clang getting started page) compiled with cmake.

In the directory where you cloned/extracted CppAnalyze::

    mkdir build-debug
    cd build-debug
    ccmake ..
    make


Test
====

For now, just run test.sh.
